  "body": "# Zork - Murder in the catacombs\r\n\r\nWelcome to my super awesome (almost) Zork-like game!!! \r\nThis is a project for my university, UPC, in which I'm studying Videogame Design and Development ^^\r\n\r\nSo, this is MY own version of the classic text-based adventure game Zork. I've modified the story and the map of the game, creating my very own version of it. The game mechanics are still the same, though. You can move around, pick up objects or battle against enemies by giving some pretty simple commands, such as \"north\" (if you're too lazy to write the whole word, then yes, you can indeed write just \"n\" to go north).\r\n\r\nThis Zork takes place in an (unnamed) fantasy world, where dragons (yay! :dragon: ) and goblins (nay... :cry: )exist. You are a runaway, running from a paid assassin who, as its name suggests, is trying to assassinate you. DO you think you'll be able to meet the requirements to either escape him or confront, and eventually kill him? You'll only know if you give it a try.\r\n\r\nOh. And be careful. There is indeed a dragon :dragon:. I'm not lying.\r\n\r\nCheck out the game map [here](https://github.com/ilammens/Zork/blob/master/Zork_1/Zork_Map.jpg).\r\nIt's kinda cheating but, well... Your decision!\r\n\r\nCommands you can use in this game:\r\n- north/go north/n (available with north, south, east, west directions)\r\n- look/look north (available in all directions)\r\n- help\r\n- quit\r\n- open east/close east (only one door can be opened/closed)\r\n\r\n13 rooms to explore! \r\nEnjoy!!\r\n\r\n###Author: Isabel Lammens :) :dragon:",
