# Zork - Murder in the catacombs

###NOTE: While working in class, one commit was created under another account accidentally, because another user had previously logged in in that computer's GitHub Desktop (which doesn't log out the last user automatically...). This commit was then reverted and done again but this time under MY username, ilammens. That's why ot appears like there have been 2 contributors (false, only I have written the code).

Implemented commands:
- north/go north/n (avilable with north, south, east, west directions)
- look/look north (available in all directions)
- help
- quit
- open east/close east (only one door can be opened/closed)

13 rooms to explore! Each of them has different descriptions and names.
